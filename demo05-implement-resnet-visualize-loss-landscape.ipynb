We will stick to the case of CNNs where the **weight layer** in the above image is a 2D convolutional layer. Another common rule of thumb is to see `BatchNorm` added directly after a `Conv` layer (as discussed in class). Since `BatchNorm` contains learned parameters, we can think of them as being part of our weight layer. The image below shows residual blocks in action in a 34-layer networks (note that adding a skip connection does not increase the number of trainable parameters).\n",
